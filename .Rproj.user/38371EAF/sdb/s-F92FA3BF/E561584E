Despite the importance of genetic contributions to historical yield increases, little is known about the underlying genomic changes. Here we use high-density SNP genotyping to characterize a set of North American maize lines spanning the history of modern breeding. We provide a unique analysis of genome-wide developments in genetic diversity, ancestry, and selection. The genomic history of maize is marked by a steady increase in genetic differentiation and linkage disequilibrium, whereas allele frequencies in the total population have remained relatively constant. These changes are associated with increasing genetic separation of breeding pools and decreased diversity in the ancestry of individual lines. We confirm that modern heterotic groups are the product of ongoing divergence from a relatively homogeneous landrace population, but show that differential landrace ancestry remains evident. Using a recent association approach, we characterize signals of directional selection throughout the genome, identifying a number of candidate genes of potential agronomic relevance. However, overall we find that selection has had limited impact on genome-wide patterns of diversity and ancestry, with little evidence for individual lines contributing disproportionately to the accumulation of favorable alleles in today's elite germplasm. Our data suggest breeding progress has mainly involved selection and recombination of relatively common alleles, contributed by a representative but limited set of ancestral lines.},\n\tAuthor = {van Heerwaarden, Joost and Hufford, Matthew B and Ross-Ibarra, Jeffrey},\n\tDate-Added = {2014-02-28 00:32:33 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2014-02-28 00:32:51 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1073/pnas.1209275109},\n\tJournal = {Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A},\n\tJournal-Full = {Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America},\n\tMesh = {Alleles; Breeding; Genome, Plant; Genome-Wide Association Study; Genomics; Linkage Disequilibrium; North America; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Zea mays},\n\tMonth = {Jul},\n\tNumber = {31},\n\tPages = {12420-5},\n\tPmc = {PMC3412004},\n\tPmid = {22802642},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {Historical genomics of North American maize},\n\tVolume = {109},\n\tYear = {2012},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Doyle1987,\n\tAuthor = {Doyle, J.

Our methods make use of known haplotype phase when it is available, and our methods are computationally efficient so that the full information in large reference panels with thousands of individuals is utilized. We demonstrate that substantial gains in imputation accuracy accrue with increasingly large reference panel sizes, particularly when imputing low-frequency variants, and that unphased reference panels can provide highly accurate genotype imputation. We place our methodology in a unified framework that enables the simultaneous use of unphased and phased data from trios and unrelated individuals in a single analysis. For unrelated individuals, our imputation methods produce well-calibrated posterior genotype probabilities and highly accurate allele-frequency estimates. For trios, our haplotype-inference method is four orders of magnitude faster than the gold-standard PHASE program and has excellent accuracy. Our methods enable genotype imputation to be performed with unphased trio or unrelated reference panels, thus accounting for haplotype-phase uncertainty in the reference panel. We present a useful measure of imputation accuracy, allelic R(2), and show that this measure can be estimated accurately from posterior genotype probabilities. Our methods are implemented in version 3.0 of the BEAGLE software package.},\n\tAuthor = {Browning, Brian L and Browning, Sharon R},\n\tDate-Added = {2014-02-19 21:10:34 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2014-02-19 21:10:56 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1016/j.ajhg.2009.01.005},\n\tJournal = {Am J Hum Genet},\n\tJournal-Full = {American journal of human genetics},\n\tMesh = {Computer Simulation; Female; Gene Frequency; Genotype; Haplotypes; Humans; Male; Markov Chains; Models, Genetic; Nuclear Family; Reproducibility of Results},\n\tMonth = {Feb},\n\tNumber = {2},\n\tPages = {210-23},\n\tPmc = {PMC2668004},\n\tPmid = {19200528},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {A unified approach to genotype imputation and haplotype-phase inference for large data sets of trios and unrelated individuals},\n\tVolume = {84},\n\tYear = {2009},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Browning2011,\n\tAbstract = {We present a method, fastIBD, for finding tracts of identity by descent (IBD) between pairs of individuals. FastIBD can be applied to thousands of samples across genome-wide SNP data and is significantly more powerful for finding short tracts of IBD than existing methods for finding IBD tracts in such data. We show that fastIBD can detect facets of population structure that are not revealed by other methods. In the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium bipolar disorder case-control data, we find a genome-wide excess of IBD in case-case pairs of individuals compared to control-control pairs. We show that this excess can be explained by the geographical clustering of cases. We also show that it is possible to use fastIBD to generate highly accurate estimates of genome-wide IBD sharing between pairs of distant relatives. This is useful for estimation of relationship and for adjusting for relatedness in association studies. FastIBD is incorporated in the freely available Beagle software package.},\n\tAuthor = {Browning, Brian L and Browning, Sharon R},\n\tDate-Added = {2014-02-19 21:10:34 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2014-02-19 21:10:50 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.01.010},\n\tJournal = {Am J Hum Genet},\n\tJournal-Full = {American journal of human genetics},\n\tMesh = {Bipolar Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Chromosome Mapping; Cohort Studies; Computer Simulation; Genetics, Population; Genome-Wide Association Study; Great Britain; Haplotypes; Homozygote; Humans; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Software},\n\tMonth = {Feb},\n\tNumber = {2},\n\tPages = {173-82},\n\tPmc = {PMC3035716},\n\tPmid = {21310274},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {A fast, powerful method for detecting identity by descent},\n\tVolume = {88},\n\tYear = {2011},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Li2009B,\n\tAbstract = {MOTIVATION: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals.\nRESULTS: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is approximately 10-20x faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package.\nAVAILABILITY: http://maq.sourceforge.net.},\n\tAuthor = {Li, Heng and Durbin, Richard},\n\tDate-Added = {2013-10-11 03:38:42 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2013-10-11 03:39:09 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1093/bioinformatics/btp324},\n\tJournal = {Bioinformatics},\n\tJournal-Full = {Bioinformatics (Oxford, England)},\n\tMesh = {Algorithms; Genomics; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Software},\n\tMonth = {Jul},\n\tNumber = {14},\n\tPages = {1754-60},\n\tPmc = {PMC2705234},\n\tPmid = {19451168},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {Fast and accurate short read alignment with Burrows-Wheeler transform},\n\tVolume = {25},\n\tYear = {2009},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {YnBsaXN0MDDUAQIDBAUGJCVYJHZlcnNpb25YJG9iamVjdHNZJGFyY2hpdmVyVCR0b3ASAAGGoKgHCBMUFRYaIVUkbnVsbNMJCgsMDxJXTlMua2V5c1pOUy5vYmplY3RzViRjbGFzc6INDoACgAOiEBGABIAFgAdccmVsYXRpdmVQYXRoWWFsaWFzRGF0YV8QMi4uLy4uLy4uL0JpYmxpb2dyYXBoeS9CaWJEZXNrLURpYWxsZWwvMTk0NTExNjgucGRm0hcLGBlXTlMuZGF0YU8RAZwAAAAAAZwAAgAADE1hY2ludG9zaCBIRAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMwxLxJIKwAAAW1dmAwxOTQ1MTE2OC5wZGYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABxxkyzn0+NAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAwAACSAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPQmliRGVzay1EaWFsbGVsAAAQAAgAAMwxEvIAAAARAAgAAM59IhQAAAABAAwBbV2YAAdypgAHZJcAAgBFTWFjaW50b3NoIEhEOlBvc3Rkb2NfSlJJOgBCaWJsaW9ncmFwaHk6AEJpYkRlc2stRGlhbGxlbDoAMTk0NTExNjgucGRmAAAOABoADAAxADkANAA1ADEAMQA2ADgALgBwAGQAZgAPABoADABNAGEAYwBpAG4AdABvAHMAaAAgAEgARAASADVQb3N0ZG9jX0pSSS9CaWJsaW9ncmFwaHkvQmliRGVzay1EaWFsbGVsLzE5NDUxMTY4LnBkZgAAEwABLwD//wAAgAbSGxwdHlokY2xhc3NuYW1lWCRjbGFzc2VzXU5TTXV0YWJsZURhdGGjHR8gVk5TRGF0YVhOU09iamVjdNIbHCIjXE5TRGljdGlvbmFyeaIiIF8QD05TS2V5ZWRBcmNoaXZlctEmJ1Ryb290gAEACAARABoAIwAtADIANwBAAEYATQBVAGAAZwBqAGwAbgBxAHMAdQB3AIQAjgDDAMgA0AJwAnICdwKCAosCmQKdAqQCrQKyAr8CwgLUAtcC3AAAAAAAAAIBAAAAAAAAACgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALe}}\n\n@article{Romay2013,\n\tAbstract = {BACKGROUND: Genotyping by sequencing, a new low-cost, high-throughput sequencing technology was used to genotype 2,815 maize inbred accessions, preserved mostly at the National Plant Germplasm System in the USA. The collection includes inbred lines from breeding programs all over the world. RESULTS: The method produced 681,257 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers distributed across the entire genome, with the ability to detect rare alleles at high confidence levels. More than half of the SNPs in the collection are rare. Although most rare alleles have been incorporated into public temperate breeding programs, only a modest amount of the available diversity is present in the commercial germplasm. Analysis of genetic distances shows population stratification, including a small number of large clusters centered on key lines. Nevertheless, an average fixation index of 0.06 indicates moderate differentiation between the three major maize subpopulations. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) decays very rapidly, but the extent of LD is highly dependent on the particular group of germplasm and region of the genome. The utility of these data for performing genome-wide association studies was tested with two simply inherited traits and one complex trait. We identified trait associations at SNPs very close to known candidate genes for kernel color, sweet corn, and flowering time; however, results suggest that more SNPs are needed to better explore the genetic architecture of complex traits.

Characterizing standing variation in this complex genome has been challenging, with only a small fraction of it described to date. Using a population genetics scoring model, we identified 55 million SNPs in 103 lines across pre-domestication and domesticated Zea mays varieties, including a representative from the sister genus Tripsacum. We find that structural variations are pervasive in the Z. mays genome and are enriched at loci associated with important traits. By investigating the drivers of genome size variation, we find that the larger Tripsacum genome can be explained by transposable element abundance rather than an allopolyploid origin. In contrast, intraspecies genome size variation seems to be controlled by chromosomal knob content. There is tremendous overlap in key gene content in maize and Tripsacum, suggesting that adaptations from Tripsacum (for example, perennialism and frost and drought tolerance) can likely be integrated into maize.},\n\tAuthor = {Chia, Jer-Ming and Song, Chi and Bradbury, Peter J and Costich, Denise and de Leon, Natalia and Doebley, John and Elshire, Robert J and Gaut, Brandon and Geller, Laura and Glaubitz, Jeffrey C and Gore, Michael and Guill, Kate E and Holland, Jim and Hufford, Matthew B and Lai, Jinsheng and Li, Meng and Liu, Xin and Lu, Yanli and McCombie, Richard and Nelson, Rebecca and Poland, Jesse and Prasanna, Boddupalli M and Pyh{\\\"a}j{\\\"a}rvi, Tanja and Rong, Tingzhao and Sekhon, Rajandeep S and Sun, Qi and Tenaillon, Maud I and Tian, Feng and Wang, Jun and Xu, Xun and Zhang, Zhiwu and Kaeppler, Shawn M and Ross-Ibarra, Jeffrey and McMullen, Michael D and Buckler, Edward S and Zhang, Gengyun and Xu, Yunbi and Ware, Doreen},\n\tDate-Added = {2013-04-29 19:53:26 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2013-04-29 19:53:39 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1038/ng.2313},\n\tJournal = {Nat Genet},\n\tJournal-Full = {Nature genetics},\n\tMesh = {Alleles; DNA Transposable Elements; Genome Size; Genome, Plant; HapMap Project; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Selection, Genetic; Zea mays},\n\tMonth = {Jul},\n\tNumber = {7},\n\tPages = {803-7},\n\tPmid = {22660545},\n\tPst = {epublish},\n\tTitle = {Maize HapMap2 identifies extant variation from a genome in flux},\n\tVolume = {44},\n\tYear = {2012},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Benjamini1995,\n\tAuthor = {Benjamini, Y and Hochberg, Y},\n\tDate-Added = {2012-10-08 20:01:14 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2012-10-16 02:04:25 +0000},\n\tJournal = {J R Stat Soc},\n\tPages = {289-300},\n\tTitle = {Controlling the false discovery rate: a practical and powerful approach to multiple testing},\n\tVolume = {57},\n\tYear = {1995},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Langmead2012,\n\tAbstract = {As the rate of sequencing increases, greater throughput is demanded from read aligners.

An understanding of the regulation of kernel starch, protein, and oil is needed in order to manipulate composition to meet future needs. We conducted joint-linkage quantitative trait locus mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for kernel starch, protein, and oil in the maize nested association mapping population, composed of 25 recombinant inbred line families derived from diverse inbred lines. Joint-linkage mapping revealed that the genetic architecture of kernel composition traits is controlled by 21-26 quantitative trait loci. Numerous GWAS associations were detected, including several oil and starch associations in acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase1-2, a gene that regulates oil composition and quantity. Results from nested association mapping were verified in a 282 inbred association panel using both GWAS and candidate gene association approaches. We identified many beneficial alleles that will be useful for improving kernel starch, protein, and oil content.},\n\tAuthor = {Cook, Jason P and McMullen, Michael D and Holland, James B and Tian, Feng and Bradbury, Peter and Ross-Ibarra, Jeffrey and Buckler, Edward S and Flint-Garcia, Sherry A},\n\tDate-Added = {2012-10-10 00:05:10 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2012-10-10 00:05:24 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1104/pp.111.185033},\n\tJournal = {Plant Physiol},\n\tJournal-Full = {Plant physiology},\n\tMesh = {Genes, Plant; Genetic Linkage; Genome-Wide Association Study; Quantitative Trait Loci; Zea mays},\n\tMonth = {Feb},\n\tNumber = {2},\n\tPages = {824-34},\n\tPmc = {PMC3271770},\n\tPmid = {22135431},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {Genetic architecture of maize kernel composition in the nested association mapping and inbred association panels},\n\tVolume = {158},\n\tYear = {2012},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Ng2003,\n\tAuthor = {Ng, Pauline C and Henikoff, Steven},\n\tDate-Added = {2012-10-08 20:01:14 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2013-01-31 21:36:47 +0000},\n\tJournal = {Nucl Acids Res},\n\tNumber = {13},\n\tPages = {3812-3814},\n\tTitle = {SIFT: predicting amino acid changes that affect protein function},\n\tVolume = {31},\n\tYear = {2003},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Ng2006,\n\tAbstract = {Nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) are coding variants that introduce amino acid changes in their corresponding proteins.

Here we provide an overview of amino acid substitution (AAS) prediction methods, which use sequence and/or structure to predict the effect of an AAS on protein function. Most methods predict approximately 25-30% of human nsSNPs to negatively affect protein function, and such nsSNPs tend to be rare in the population. We discuss the utility of AAS prediction methods for Mendelian and complex diseases as well as their broader applications for understanding protein function.},\n\tAuthor = {Ng, Pauline C and Henikoff, Steven},\n\tDate-Added = {2012-10-08 20:01:14 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2012-10-08 20:02:09 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1146/annurev.genom.7.080505.115630},\n\tJournal = {Annu Rev Genomics Hum Genet},\n\tJournal-Full = {Annual review of genomics and human genetics},\n\tMesh = {Amino Acid Sequence; Amino Acid Substitution; Humans; Models, Molecular; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Protein Conformation; Proteins},\n\tPages = {61-80},\n\tPmid = {16824020},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {Predicting the effects of amino acid substitutions on protein function},\n\tVolume = {7},\n\tYear = {2006},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Stone2005,\n\tAbstract = {We find that the degree of impairment of protein function by missense variants is predictable by comparative sequence analysis alone. The applicable range of impairment is not confined to binary predictions that distinguish normal from deleterious variants, but extends continuously from mild to severe effects. The accuracy of predictions is strongly dependent on sequence variation and is highest when diverse orthologs are available. High predictive accuracy is achieved by quantification of the physicochemical characteristics in each position of the protein, based on observed evolutionary variation. The strong relationship between physicochemical characteristics of a missense variant and impairment of protein function extends to human disease. By using four diverse proteins for which sufficient comparative sequence data are available, we show that grades of disease, or likelihood of developing cancer, correlate strongly with physicochemical constraint violation by causative amino acid variants.},\n\tAuthor = {Stone, Eric A and Sidow, Arend},\n\tDate-Added = {2012-10-08 20:01:14 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2012-10-08 20:01:30 +0000},\n\tDoi = {10.1101/gr.3804205},\n\tJournal = {Genome Res},\n\tJournal-Full = {Genome research},\n\tMesh = {Algorithms; Amino Acid Substitution; Anemia; Evolution, Molecular; Genetic Techniques; HIV Infections; HIV Protease; Hemoglobins; Humans; Multivariate Analysis; Mutation, Missense; Neoplasms; Polymorphism, Genetic; Protein Conformation; Sequence Alignment; Tumor Suppressor Protein p53},\n\tMonth = {Jul},\n\tNumber = {7},\n\tPages = {978-86},\n\tPmc = {PMC1172042},\n\tPmid = {15965030},\n\tPst = {ppublish},\n\tTitle = {Physicochemical constraint violation by missense substitutions mediates impairment of protein function and disease severity},\n\tVolume = {15},\n\tYear = {2005},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@article{Thornton2003,\n\tAuthor = {Thornton,K},\n\tDate-Added = {2012-11-05 21:34:18 +0000},\n\tDate-Modified = {2012-11-05 21:38:44 +0000},\n\tJournal = {Bioinformatics},\n\tMonth = {Nov},\n\tNumber = {17},\n\tPages = {2325-2327},\n\tRating = {4},\n\tTitle = {Libsequence: a C++ class library for evolutionary genetic analysis},\n\tVolume = {19},\n\tYear = {2003},\n\tBdsk-File-1 = {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}}\n\n@book{Falconer1996,\n  title={Introduction to Quantitative Genetics},\n  author={Falconer, D.S. and Mackay, T.F.C.},\n  url={http://books.google.de/books?id=7ASZNAEACAAJ},\n  year={1996},\n  publisher={Longman}\n}\n\n@article{Mezmouk2014,\nabstract = {Most nonsynonymous mutations are thought to be deleterious because of their effect on protein sequence and are expected to be removed or kept at low frequency by the action of natural selection.

Despite their potential to affect complex trait phenotypes, deleterious alleles are difficult to study precisely because they are often at low frequency.

We show that, despite small effective population sizes and inbreeding, most putatively deleterious SNPs are indeed at low frequencies within individual genetic groups. We find that genes associated with a number of complex traits are enriched for deleterious variants.

Studying heterosis in yeast can potentially yield insights into its genetic basis, can allow one to test the different hypotheses that have been proposed to explain the phenomenon and allows better understanding of how to take advantage of this phenomenon to enhance food production. We therefore crossed 16 parental yeast strains to form 120 yeast hybrids, and measured their growth rates under five environmental conditions. A considerable amount of dominant genetic variation was found in growth performance, and heterosis was measured in 35\\% of the hybrid-condition combinations. Despite previous reports of correlations between heterosis and measures of sequence divergence between parents, we detected no such relationship. We used several analyses to examine which genetic model might explain heterosis. We found that dominance complementation of recessive alleles, overdominant interactions within loci and epistatic interactions among loci each contribute to heterosis.

Genetic studies have shown that the teosinte branched1 (tb1) gene was a major target of human selection during maize domestication, and sequence diversity in the intergenic region 5' to the tb1-coding sequence is extraordinarily low. We show that polymorphism in this region is consistent with new mutation following fixation for a small number of tb1 haplotypes during domestication. Archeological studies suggest that maize was domesticated approximately 6,250-10,000 years ago and subsequently the size of the maize population is thought to have expanded rapidly. Using the observed number of mutations within the region of selection at tb1, the approximate age of maize domestication, and approximations for the maize genealogy, we have derived estimates for the nucleotide substitution rate for the tb1 intergenic region. Using two approaches, one of which is a coalescent approach, we obtain rate estimates of approximately 2.9 x 10(-8) and 3.3 x 10(-8) substitutions per site per year. We also show that the pattern of polymorphism in the tb1 intergenic region appears to have been strongly affected by the mutagenic effect of DNA methylation. Excluding target sites of symmetric DNA methylation (CG and CNG sites) from analysis, the mutation rate estimates are reduced by approximately 50\\%-60\\%, while the rates for CG and CNG sites are nearly an order of magnitude higher.

In freely recombining regions of the genome, selection should more effectively incorporate new beneficial mutations, and eliminate deleterious ones, than in regions with low rates of genetic recombination. RESULTS: We examined the effects of recombinational environment on patterns of evolution using a genome-wide comparison of Drosophila melanogaster and D. yakuba. In regions of the genome with no crossing over, we find elevated divergence at nonsynonymous sites and in long introns, a virtual absence of codon usage bias, and an increase in gene length. However, we find little evidence for differences in patterns of evolution between regions with high, intermediate, and low crossover frequencies. In addition, genes on the fourth chromosome exhibit more extreme deviations from regions with crossing over than do other, no crossover genes outside the fourth chromosome. CONCLUSION: All of the patterns observed are consistent with a severe reduction in the efficacy of selection in the absence of crossing over, resulting in the accumulation of deleterious mutations in these regions. Our results also suggest that even a very low frequency of crossing over may be enough to maintain the efficacy of selection.},\nauthor = {Haddrill, Penelope R and Halligan, Daniel L and Tomaras, Dimitris and Charlesworth, Brian},\ndoi = {10.1186/gb-2007-8-2-r18},\nfile = {:Users/yangjl/Documents/Literatures/My research/Heterosis/gb-2007-8-2-r18.pdf:pdf},\nisbn = {1474-760X},\nissn = {1465-6914},\njournal = {Genome biology},\nnumber = {2},\npages = {R18},\npmid = {17284312},\ntitle = {{Reduced efficacy of selection in regions of the Drosophila genome that lack crossing over.}},\nvolume = {8},\nyear = {2007}\n}\n\n@article{Lariepe2012,\nabstract = {Understanding the genetic bases underlying heterosis is a major issue in maize (Zea mays L.).

Quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping was carried out on the six families obtained from crosses to parental lines following the \"classical\" NCIII method and with a multiparental connected model on the global design, adding the three families obtained from crosses to the nonparental line. Results of the QTL detection highlighted that most of the QTL detected for grain yield displayed apparent overdominance effects and limited differences between heterozygous genotypes, whereas for grain moisture predominance of additive effects was observed. For plant height and silking date results were intermediate. Except for grain yield, most of the QTL identified showed significant additive-by-additive epistatic interactions. High correlation observed between heterosis and the heterozygosity of hybrids at markers confirms the complex genetic basis and the role of dominance in heterosis.

Here we present GERP++, a new tool that uses maximum likelihood evolutionary rate estimation for position-specific scoring and, in contrast to previous bottom-up methods, a novel dynamic programming approach to subsequently define constrained elements. GERP++ evaluates a richer set of candidate element breakpoints and ranks them based on statistical significance, eliminating the need for biased heuristic extension techniques. Using GERP++ we identify over 1.3 million constrained elements spanning over 7\\% of the human genome. We predict a higher fraction than earlier estimates largely due to the annotation of longer constrained elements, which improves one to one correspondence between predicted elements with known functional sequences. GERP++ is an efficient and effective tool to provide both nucleotide- and element-level constraint scores within deep multiple sequence alignments.},\nauthor = {Davydov, Eugene V and Goode, David L and Sirota, Marina and Cooper, Gregory M and Sidow, Arend and Batzoglou, Serafim},\ndoi = {10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001025},\nfile = {:Users/yangjl/Documents/Literatures/My research/Evolution/2010DavydovEtAl.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {1553-7358},\njournal = {PLoS computational biology},\nkeywords = {Algorithms,Animals,Genome, Human,Genome, Human: genetics,Genomics,Genomics: methods,Humans,Mammals,Mammals: genetics,Models, Genetic,Phylogeny,Sequence Alignment,Sequence Alignment: methods,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Software,User-Computer Interface},\nmonth = jan,\nnumber = {12},\npages = {e1001025},\npmid = {21152010},\ntitle = {{Identifying a high fraction of the human genome to be under selective constraint using GERP++.}},\nurl = {http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2996323\\&tool=pmcentrez\\&rendertype=abstract},\nvolume = {6},\nyear = {2010}\n}\n\n@article{Cooper2005,\nabstract = {Comparisons of orthologous genomic DNA sequences can be used to characterize regions that have been subject to purifying selection and are enriched for functional elements. We here present the results of such an analysis on an alignment of sequences from 29 mammalian species. The alignment captures approximately 3.9 neutral substitutions per site and spans approximately 1.9 Mbp of the human genome. We identify constrained elements from 3 bp to over 1 kbp in length, covering approximately 5.5\\% of the human locus. Our estimate for the total amount of nonexonic constraint experienced by this locus is roughly twice that for exonic constraint. Constrained elements tend to cluster, and we identify large constrained regions that correspond well with known functional elements. While constraint density inversely correlates with mobile element density, we also show the presence of unambiguously constrained elements overlapping mammalian ancestral repeats. In addition, we describe a number of elements in this region that have undergone intense purifying selection throughout mammalian evolution, and we show that these important elements are more numerous than previously thought. These results were obtained with Genomic Evolutionary Rate Profiling (GERP), a statistically rigorous and biologically transparent framework for constrained element identification. GERP identifies regions at high resolution that exhibit nucleotide substitution deficits, and measures these deficits as \"rejected substitutions\". Rejected substitutions reflect the intensity of past purifying selection and are used to rank and characterize constrained elements. We anticipate that GERP and the types of analyses it facilitates will provide further insights and improved annotation for the human genome as mammalian genome sequence data become richer.},\nauthor = {Cooper, Gregory M and Stone, Eric a and Asimenos, George and Green, Eric D and Batzoglou, Serafim and Sidow, Arend},\ndoi = {10.1101/gr.3577405},\nfile = {:Users/yangjl/Documents/Literatures/My research/Evolution/2005CooperEtAlGERP.pdf:pdf},\nissn = {1088-9051},\njournal = {Genome research},\nkeywords = {Animals,Base Sequence,Computational Biology,Computational Biology: methods,Conserved Sequence,Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulato,Evolution, Molecular,Gene Components,Gene Expression Profiling,Gene Expression Profiling: methods,Genome,Humans,Interspersed Repetitive Sequences,Mammals,Mammals: genetics,Molecular Sequence Data,Sensitivity and Specificity,Sequence Alignment,Sequence Analysis, DNA,Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid},\nmonth = jul,\nnumber = {7},\npages = {901--13},\npmid = {15965027},\ntitle = {{Distribution and intensity of constraint in mammalian genomic sequence.}},\nurl = {http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1172034\\&tool=pmcentrez\\&rendertype=abstract},\nvolume = {15},\nyear = {2005}\n}\n\n",
